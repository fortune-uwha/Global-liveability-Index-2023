## Project Overviewüìñ

The goal of this project is to provide insights and visualizations based on the Airbnb data in New York City. It includes interactive charts and filters to explore different aspects of the data, such as pricing trends, neighborhood comparisons, and room types.

## Getting Startedü¶ò
To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies (see the [Dependencies](#dependencies) section for details).
3. Get the EIU dataset for Global liveable cities (see the [Data](#data) section for details).
4. Run the project script or notebook to generate visualization and explore the data.

## Dependencies

The project relies on the following dependencies:

- Python 3
- Pandas
- Plottable

## Data

The dataset used in this project is obtained from the Economist Intelligence Unit released 2023 report on global liveability index. It rates living conditions in 173 cities across five categories: stability, health care, culture and environment, education and infrastructure. You can get the dataset [here](https://github.com/fortune-uwha/Global-liveability-Index-2023/blob/main/Data/cities.csv).

Once you have the dataset, update the file path in the project script or notebook accordingly.
